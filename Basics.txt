Press Alt = Hand tool
Always keep camera in 80 so you can see things while building
Double click on any item in Hierarchy to go there

Setting a good layout:
See 1.1


Resolution = Device dimensions

Pixels vs Units
---------------
100 pixels per unit would mean a sprite that's 100 pixels would equal 1 unit in the scene.
It's simply a scale to say how many pixels equal one unit. This can affect things like physics. 
A lower pixels to units setting would require more force to move one unit than a higher pixels to units setting.

Yes, there may be times where you'll want to manipulate the pixels per unit.
If you have a tile sheet of 16x16 tiles, you may want to consider setting the pixels per unit to 16 so that you can easily snap tiles together in a scene, for example.

SpriteSheets
-------------
SpriteMode: Multiple  => Enables Sprite Editor button 
FilterMode: Point => Makes sure pixel art looks crisp
Format: True Color => 


Sprite Editor:
Type: Grid by Cell Size
Pixel Size: X, Y = 34, 34
Offset: 2, 2
Padding 2, 2
Pivot: Center
just close 



Grouping Sprites
Select all sprites and give a packing tag 
Window Menu-> Sprite packer: This packs all items with same packing tags
(This grouping aka batching reduces the system calls to the sprites)



Textures:
---------
Selecet a texture
Texture type: Texture
wrap mode; repeat   //now texture will repeat whenever we add it to a surface
filter mode: point
format: True color


Creation of Game Object:
------------------------
Gameobj menu -> 3D -> Quad
Quad is gonna be really small because pixels-to-units are so high

Benefits of Quad:
They allow you to resize and scale them and 
give you a large surface to attch artwork to, especially a background in a 2D game

Give quad scale of 32x32 and double click in hierarchy to zoom out

The z-index for camera is set at -10 by default (remember)
give z-index for quad to 2 so that it'll go further away from camera.
(In 2D z is not required but quad is a 3D obj and we want to make sure they are layered correctly)



Shader -> Mobiles -> Alpha Blended












Remove mesh collider for any quad (it's for 3d games)
